//2. The scope of a var variable is functional scope, let is blocked scope, const is blocked scope.

//3. Number("98")// -->98, String(123)//-->"123", toString(123);// Boolean("arghya")//-->true

//6. Boolean(Null,undefined,"",0)-->falsy
//7. || operator return first truthy value, if there is no truthy value then return last falsy value
//8. && operator return first falsy value, or last truthy value if all the values are truthy.
//9. nullish coalescing(??) will only give the alternative value when other one is Null or Undefined
//10. suppose, all values are Null or undefined it will return the last-one
